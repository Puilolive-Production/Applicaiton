# Puilolive Production
Puilolive Production is a project formed from a EITC project. In this project, we will develop a Gym room system. This is a gym + face recognition application.
## Form of the App
- [Javascript + react](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVClHLwv-4I) / Go web application
- Android: Android studio w/ Java
- Unity (weird choice but somehow works **maybe**)
- Python PC application
- Magic Mirror + Rasberry pi (somehow it is complexer than the other options)
## What can the application do?
It is so called "Gym's health companion".
It can:
- giving advice, 
- recording your habbit (but wt habbit?), 
- taking attendance, 
- making a report on yourselves, 
- AI couch, 
- Set and helping you to achieve a goal, 
- PuiHomeSafe (安心pui pui)
## What hardware does it requires?
- webcam/camera (phone camera is fine), 
- monitor/magic mirror, 
- microphone for voice input, 
- speaker or stuff like that for voice output.
## Steps to use the application
- Initial process (Registing):
	The user has to input their personal information (age, weight, height, ideal weight...) to the system for a better planning of the fitness plan. (also pics for face recognition)

- Face recogniting:
	The application would then remember the info of the user as they have already input them in step 1.
When the user needs to login to use the application again in the future, they would only need to use their face to be the media to login the system.
Some extra info (time, date, temperature, etc.) and greeting from the sys will be provided to the user as well. They are unneccesary, but just providing a better UX to the user.

- Taking Attendance & PuiHomeSafe 
	In this stage, the sys will automatically recording the user's pysical location and the current activity they are doing, for taking the attendance for the course from the gym (or the aim the user had set). PuiHomeSafe system would also be activited.
	### PuiHomeSafe 
	PuiHomeSafe is a system that designed for the gym rooms to use during this diffcult time. 
	Under the virus attack, everyone rather stay at their home instead of going out. Therefore, many industries are face a great loss, escaspecially the fitness industry.
	In order to encourage the citizens to go to the fitness centre, PuiHomeSafe can be solution. PuiHomeSafe is a system that allows the user to marking down the place they have been to, which helps the govenment better understand the source of the virus (, and also tracking the citizens).
